Updated info for educational purposes:  Four main indicators, even with this blurry image, that this is not a Sabine's Gull, but rather a young juvenile Laughing Gull-- 1. Most importantly, long bill, giving head a longer look rather than the ""snouty"" look of the Sabine's; 2. Lacks the well-defined white forehead and throat, instead with a light gray around face and eyes; 3. Gray crossing breast rather than restricted to upper breast; 4. Lack of neat Sabine's scaling on back.    Thanks to reviewers Louis Bevier and Luke Seitz for feedback.    Original comment: Unconfirmed ID-- Off of rocks at Reid state park directly to the left of entrance to beach. ~40ft off shore with ring-billed gulls, herring gulls, and eiders. Probably 2/3 the size of a ring bill or smaller with marks matching pics of juveniles from internet. We also noted a gull (perhaps the same one?) with a notable v marks on wings, further suggesting Sabine's over possible juv. laughing gull. White breast and relatively dark back near tail.",<br />Submitted from eBird Android 1.2.5
