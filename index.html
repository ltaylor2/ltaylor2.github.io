				I'm a third-year Ph.D. candidate (NSF GRFP) in the Department of Ecology and Evolutionary Biology at Yale University. My graduate research (with Dr. Richard Prum) focuses on avian adolesence, deferred reproduction, and the evolution of delayed plumage maturation in birds. I also have an interest in the intersection of biology and cultural anthropology; I'm curious about what biologists mean (and what they think they mean) when they say that something <em>means</em> something. With a background in computer science, I try to pursue complex modeling approaches whenever I can remember how to change the working directory in Python.
			</p>
			<p>
				Some current research projects include:
				<ul>
					<li>An effort to situate our understanding of delayed plumage maturation within the broader frameoworks of life history theory, sexual selection theory, and evo-devo.</li>
					<li>An attempt to frame the role of social agency (genuine </em>telos</em>!) in Sexual and Artifical Selection.</li>
					<li>A long-running project using object-oriented models to determine energetic expectations for biparental incubation behavior in Leach's Storm-petrels (<em>Oceanodroma leucorhoa</em>)</li>
					<li>Some work on population structure and phylogenetics using ddRAD-seq data. Right now, I'm working to investigate species boundaries in a tropical thrush with a highly disjunct distribution.</li>
			</p>
			<p>
				Some past fieldwork includes:
				<ul>
					<li>Golden-winged Manakins in the cloud forests of Ecuador</li>
					<li>Semipalmated Plovers in the subartic of Churchill, Manitoba</li>
					<li>Two seasons with <span class=comment title="a.k.a. Chuck Huntington's">Leach's</span> Storm-petrels on Kent Island, New Brunswick</li>
				</ul>
			</p>
			<p>
				I'm also an
				<span class="comment" title="I put the 'which?' in whichety-whichety-whichety">OK</span>
				birder (think companion-species, not rare-bird-alert) and a collector of

				hobbies.

					<p> SOME CURRENT PRESSING QUESTIONS: </p>
            <li>Where the <em>heck</em> do I get a good bagel in New Haven?</li>
						<li>Why do they not make mirror images of all the animal crackers so I can put them up next to each other and make even just one full animal?</li>
            <li>Ruin Crab? Really?</li>
            <li>What are the odds that that meteor hit just like, right on the K-Pg boundary?</li>
						<li>Why do I get looks when I use my mouth to hold a micropipette?</li>
						<li>Does "ePoster" just mean I can work on it on the flight over?</li>
						<li>How long can I keep using the same no-knead bread recipe before people start asking questions?</li>
						<li>Why hasn't my taxonomy of "bird/good-bird/really-good-bird/truly-good-bird" caught on yet?</li>
						<li>Does anyone ever just purl the whole thing and then flip it inside out?</li>
