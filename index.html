				I'm a first-year Ph.D. student (NSF GRFP) in the Ecology and Evolutionary Biology Department at Yale University. My graduate research will focus on
				merging sexual selection theory with phylogenetic modeling and the behavioral ecology of mating displays in manakins (Pipridae). I am excited to link my interests in sexual selection research with broader social reproductive systems in birds (such as the coordination of biparental care). With a background in computer science, I also pursue research opportunities in complex modeling approaches (particularly for avian demography) and computational tools for fieldwork (such as machine vision and machine learning).
				<br>
				<br>
				Some past fieldwork includes:
				<ul>
					<li>Golden-winged Manakins in the cloud forests of Ecuador</li>
					<li>Semipalmated Plovers in the subartic of Churchill, Manitoba</li>
					<li>Two seasons learning the trade with <span class=comment title="/Chuck's">Leach's</span> Storm-petrels on Kent Island, New Brunswick, Canada</li>
				</ul>
			</p>
			<p>
				I'm also an  
				<span class="comment" title="I put the 'which?' in whichity-whichity-which">OK</span>
				birder, a 
				<span class="comment" title="in both skill and attitude">miserable</span> 
				taker-of-bird-photos, and a collector of 
				<span class="comment" title="but not actually rustic, that's too daunting">rustic-seeming</span> 
				hobbies.

					<p> CURRENT PRESSING QUESTIONS: </p>
					<ul>
						<li>How long can I keep using the same no-knead bread recipe for dinners before people start asking questions?</li>
						<li>How humid does it have to be for my knitting to block itself?</li>
						<li>What are the odds that a meteor happened to fall right during the K-Pg boundary?</li>
						<li>Why hasn't my finely-tuned taxonomy of "bird/good-bird/really-good-bird/truly-good-bird" caught on yet?</li>
						<li>Does anyone ever just purl the whole thing and then flip it inside out?</li>
						<li>Hypothetically, just asking for a friend, how much longer does one have to keep feeding that crow all their moose stew before one starts gaining its trust?</li>
